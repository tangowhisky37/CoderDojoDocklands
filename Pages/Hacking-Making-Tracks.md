title: Hacking & Making Tracks 
---

At CoderDojo Docklands our aim is to ignite, inspire and create. We strongly believe that every child is a born maker, however it's only through providing our kids the right environment can we aim to ignite those interests and inspire them to create, make and transform. At CoderDojo Docklands there is a strong focus on community, peer learning, youth mentoring and self led learning. There is a large emphasis on showing how coding, making and hacking is a force for change in the world and for transforming lives. Our environment at Coder Dojo Docklands includes offering kids/parents access to the right set of tools, development tracks, curriculum content, safe space to create/make and most importantly the volunteer/mentors who support the parent/child team all through the term.  

We have moved all our tutorials and learning tracks to our Learning Management System (LMS) at [KidzCanCode.com](https://learning.kidzcancode.com/). Check out the website for detailed tutorials.

The following section offers more details on the content of each of the tracks. All questions, comments, input and feedback to dojo@hack2.live

## Tracks On Offer

CoderDojo Docklands operates slightly differently to most schools you would have been to or heard of. At CoderDojo Docklands we offer various creating, making and coding tracks which the kids can choose from depending on where they are in the learning cycle. However the kid/parent team works together and has the ability to move between tracks as they see fit. We absolutely encourage moving between tracks and trying out different aspects of creating/making. The Dojo will recommend course tracks depending on where the child is in their learning cycle and will support the parent/child on the relevant course tracks through the rest of a term.

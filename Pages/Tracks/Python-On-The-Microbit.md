## Track - Python On The Microbit

This section lists the content covered under the Python On The Microbit track.

This course is designed to run through an entire term (10-12 weeks) assuming that one lesson is worked upon at every class. 

Python is a really popular programming language used by companies like Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Instagram, and Reddit. Python is used for all sorts of things like building websites, web scraping, data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing. The language is designed to be easy to read, while still being very powerful, which makes it a great language for beginners to learn. Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.

Python is an easy programming language for beginners to start out with. It’s newer than a lot of languages, so it’s easier to learn than some of the older languages (they fix a lot of the things they learned that suck about older languages), there’s a lot of demand for Python programmers (the average Python developer salary in the US is $102,000 according to Indeed.com), and you can do some really cool things with Python from data science to building websites.

This course introduces kids to programming with Python on the micro:bit. It will be the kids first foray into programming real world electronic devices using a really widely used (and popular) programming language.

## Track - Scratch Junior

This section lists the content covered under the Scratch Junior track.

This course is designed to run through an entire term (10-12 weeks) assuming that one lesson is worked upon at every class. 

Scratch is a free visual programming language and online community used by millions of children around the world. With Scratch, children can create their own interactive stories, games and animations, then share and discuss their creations with one another. Developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab to help children (ages 8 and up) learn to think creatively, reason systematically and work collaboratively. Scratch is translated into 70+ languages and is used in homes, schools, and after-school clubs in every country in the world. Scratch is often used in teaching coding, computer science, and computational thinking. Teachers also use it as a creative tool across many other subjects including math, science, history, geography, and art. As of late 2017, there were more than 22 million registered members of the Scratch online community and more than 26 million shared projects, with roughly 25,000 new members and 30,000 new projects every day. The blocks-based grammar of Scratch has influenced many other programming environments and is now considered a standard for introductory coding experiences for children.

This course introduces our bright little kids (5-6) year olds to the absolute basics of computer science using Scratch Junior. Scratch Junior is a derivative of Scratch.

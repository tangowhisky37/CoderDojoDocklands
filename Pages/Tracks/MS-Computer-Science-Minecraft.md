## Track - Introduction To Computer Science Using MineCraft 

This section lists the content covered under the Introduction To Computer Science Using Minecraft track. 

This course is designed to run through an entire term (10-12 weeks) assuming that one lesson is worked upon at every class. 

Computer science is a 21st-century skill that enables kids to be creators, rather than just consumers, of technology. Its emphasis on problem solving is applicable across disciplines, driving growth and innovation across all sectors of the workforce. This course introduces various Computer Science concepts through coding scenarios in Minecraft. Minecraft is a sandbox video game created and designed by Swedish game designer Markus "Notch" Persson, and later fully developed and published by Mojang. The creative and building aspects of Minecraft allow players to build with a variety of different cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world. Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat. This course is great for kids who have interest in playing games, uses the virtual world of minecraft to engage them and introduce them to various Computer Science fundamentals.
